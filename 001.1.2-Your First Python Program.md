# Your First Python Program

## Overview
In this lesson, we will guide you through writing your very first Python program. By the end of this lesson, you'll learn how to run a Python script that prints a message to the screen. This simple exercise will familiarize you with Python syntax and running Python scripts.

## Introduction

Python's simplicity makes it an ideal language for beginners. The traditional first program in any programming language is "Hello, World!" because it's a simple way to introduce the basic syntax of a programming language. In Python, this can be accomplished with just one line of code.

### Writing Your First Program

- **Open a Text Editor**: Start by opening a text editor of your choice. This could be Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or Gedit on Linux. For a more programming-focused experience, you might consider using a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
- **Write the Code**: Type the following line in your text editor:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")

- **Save the File**: Save your file with a .py extension, which denotes a Python script. You might name it `hello_world.py`.

### Running Your Program

Open the Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script.
Run the Script: Type python hello_world.py and press Enter. You should see the message Hello, World! printed to the terminal.

### Understanding the Code

- **The print() Function**: The `print()` function in Python outputs the string provided to it to the console. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.

- **Comments**: You can add comments to your Python code using the # symbol. Anything following # on a line is ignored by Python, allowing you to annotate your code. For example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message
```
