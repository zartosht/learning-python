# Project: Your First Python Program

## Project Summary
In this project, you will create a simple Python program that asks for the user's name, greets them with their name, and calculates their age in a future year. This project aims to familiarize you with basic Python syntax, input/output operations, and simple arithmetic operations.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

- Python variables and data types
- Input/output operations
- Arithmetic operations

If you haven't learned these concepts yet, you can start by reading the following resources:

- [Python Variables and Data Types](001-2-Variables-and-Data-Types)
- [Python Input/Output Operations](001-1-8-Python-Input-Output-Operations)
- [Python Syntax Basics](001-1-3-Python-Syntax-Basics)

## Project Description

You will write a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Greet the User**: When the program starts, it should print a message like "Welcome to the Python program!" to the console.
2. **Ask for the User's Name**: Prompt the user to enter their name and read their input from the console.
3. **Greet the User by Name**: After getting the user's name, greet them by name. For example, if the user's name is "Alice", the program should print "Hello, Alice!".
4. **Calculate Age in a Future Year**:
    - Ask the user to enter their current age.
    - Ask the user for a future year.
    - Calculate and print the user's age in that future year.

## Example of Outcome

Here's what the interaction with your program might look like:

```
Welcome to the Python program!
Please enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
Please enter your current age: 30
Enter a future year: 2030
In 2030, you will be 40 years old.
```

## Challenges or Milestones

1. **Basic Implementation**: Implement the program with basic input/output operations and arithmetic calculations.
2. **Input Validation**: Add input validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers for age and the future year.
3. **Current Year Calculation**: Use the `datetime` module to automatically fetch the current year instead of asking for the user's current age.

## Project Template

Here's a starting template for your project:

```python
# Your First Python Program

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Python program!")
    # Step 1: Ask for the user's name
    # Step 2: Greet the user by name
    # Step 3: Calculate age in a future year
    # Your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Conclusion

This project is designed to help you practice basic Python programming concepts, including working with variables, input/output operations, and basic arithmetic operations. Completing it will give you a good foundation for more complex Python projects in the future.
