### Lesson: Introduction to Python

#### Overview
This lesson provides a comprehensive introduction to Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. You'll learn about its syntax, key features, and how to write your first Python program. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of Python basics and be ready to explore more complex programming concepts.

#### Introduction
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is known for its comprehensive standard library that supports many common programming tasks directly out of the box.
