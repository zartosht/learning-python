# Python Input/Output Operations

## Overview
This lesson covers the basics of input and output (I/O) operations in Python, focusing on reading from and writing to the console and files. Understanding I/O is essential for creating interactive programs and handling data stored in files.

## Introduction

Input/output operations are fundamental in programming, allowing your applications to interact with the outside world, whether through the console, files, or other data streams.

### Console I/O

#### Reading Input

- **`input()` Function**: Used to read text input from the console. It pauses program execution and waits for the user to type something, followed by Enter.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

#### Writing Output

- **`print()` Function**: Used to display information to the console. It can take multiple arguments, separated by commas, and supports formatting options.

```python
print("This is a message.")
age = 25
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
```

### File I/O

#### Opening Files

- **`open()` Function**: Opens a file and returns a file object. It requires the file path and a mode (`'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing, `'a'` for appending).

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

#### Reading from Files

- **Methods**: `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`.
  - `read()` reads the entire file.
  - `readline()` reads the next line.
  - `readlines()` reads all lines into a list.

```python
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

#### Writing to Files

- **Methods**: `write()` and `writelines()`.
  - `write()` writes a string to the file.
  - `writelines()` writes a list of strings.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write("Hello, world!")
file.close()
```

#### Closing Files

- Always close the file after completing operations using `close()` to free up system resources.

#### Using `with` Statement

- The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed when the block is exited, even if an exception is raised.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### Best Practices

- Always use the `with` statement when dealing with file operations to ensure proper resource management.
- Validate and sanitize input when reading from the console to avoid security issues or errors.

## Conclusion

Input and output operations are the backbone of user interaction and data handling in Python. By mastering console and file I/O, you'll be well-equipped to build a wide range of applications that can interact with users and work with data stored on disk.
