### Summary
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its ease of use and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Its extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages make it a versatile tool for programmers and researchers alike.
