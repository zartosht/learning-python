# Lesson: Control Flow - If Statements and Loops in Python

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll explore the control flow tools in Python, including `if` statements, loops (`for` and `while`), and how they enable decision-making and repetition in your code. By the end, you'll understand how to use these tools to control the execution flow of your Python programs.

## Introduction

Control flow is fundamental in programming, allowing you to execute code blocks conditionally or repeatedly. Python provides simple and intuitive syntax for control flow mechanisms, making your code more dynamic and responsive to different conditions and inputs.

### If Statements

- **Purpose**: To execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  if condition:
      # code to execute if condition is true
  elif another_condition:
      # code to execute if another_condition is true
  else:
      # code to execute if no conditions above are true

- **Example**:
```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
  print("You are an adult.")
else:
  print("You are a minor.")
```

### Loops

#### For Loops

- **Purpose**: To iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.

- **Syntax**:

```python
for element in sequence:
    # code to execute for each element
```

- **Example**:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### While Loops

- **Purpose**: To execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

- **Syntax**:

```python
while condition:
    # code to execute while the condition is true
```

-- **Example**:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Break and Continue

- **break**: Used to exit a loop prematurely.

- **continue**: Skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.

- **Example**:
```python
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
    print(number)
```

### Nested Loops and Conditions

You can nest loops and if statements within each other to achieve complex decision-making and iterations.

- **Example**:
```python
for x in range(3):
    for y in range(3):
        if x == y:
            continue  # Skip the iteration when x is equal to y
        print(f"Pair: ({x}, {y})")
```

### Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing control flow with if statements and loops are crucial for creating dynamic and efficient Python programs. They allow you to handle different scenarios and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
